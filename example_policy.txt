Privacy Policy

We collect personal data from users to improve our services. This includes email addresses, phone numbers, and browsing history.

User consent is not obtained explicitly before collecting this data. The data is stored indefinitely on our servers and may be shared with third parties without prior notification.

In the event of a data breach, we may not notify users. Additionally, some information may be transmitted without encryption.

Our users do not have an option to request deletion of their data once it is stored. The use of data is not always tied to a specific purpose, and it may be used for analytics, advertising, or other undisclosed activities.

We reserve the right to modify this policy at our sole discretion, without prior notice. There is currently no privacy policy page available on our website.
