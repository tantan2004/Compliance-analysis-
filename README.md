# ðŸ›¡ Compliance Analysis Tool

**Live Demo:** [compliance-analyzer.streamlit.app](https://compliance-analyzer.streamlit.app/)

The **Compliance Analysis Tool** is an AI-powered application that automatically checks policy documents for compliance violations. It identifies rule breaches, assesses threat levels, and generates contextual summaries using LLMs through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture built on LangChain.

---

##  Project Purpose

Organizations often struggle to manually audit lengthy policy documents against dynamic regulatory requirements. This tool automates that process by:

- Comparing uploaded policy files against a set of compliance rules (`rules.json`)
- Detecting potential **rule violations**
- Assigning **risk/threat levels**
- Generating **AI summaries** using LLMs

Built with a **LangChain RAG pipeline**, **Groq models**, **FAISS vector store**, and a user-friendly **Streamlit frontend**, the tool is ideal for compliance analysts, privacy officers, and developers.

-  Rule-based violation detection
- âš Risk level classification (High, Medium, Low)
-  LLM-powered contextual understanding and summaries
-  Evaluation framework to assess model performance (`evaluation.py`)
-  Deployed and accessible online via Streamlit
